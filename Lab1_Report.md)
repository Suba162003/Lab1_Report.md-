# Lab 1: Introduction to Packet Tracer, Peer-to-Peer Communication, Study of Cables and Its Color Codes

## Objective
- To introduce Packet Tracer and its basic features.
- To understand peer-to-peer communication.
- To study different types of network cables and their color codes.

## Materials Required
- Packet Tracer software
- Network cables (Ethernet, crossover, etc.)

## Theory
### Overview of Packet Tracer
Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool that allows users to design, configure, and troubleshoot virtual networks. It provides a platform for learning networking concepts without the need for physical hardware.

### Basics of Peer-to-Peer Communication
Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication allows two devices to communicate directly with each other over a network. Each device can act as both a client and a server, facilitating file sharing and resource access without the need for a central server.

### Color Coding Standards for Network Cables
- **Ethernet Cables (Straight-Through)**: Typically use T568A or T568B standards. Common color codes include:
  - Pin 1: White with Green stripes
  - Pin 2: Green
  - Pin 3: White with Orange stripes
  - Pin 4: Blue
  - Pin 5: White with Blue stripes
  - Pin 6: Orange
  - Pin 7: White with Brown stripes
  - Pin 8: Brown

- **Crossover Cables**: Used for direct device-to-device connections. They swap the transmit and receive pairs.

## Procedure
1. **Open Packet Tracer**:
   - Launch the software and explore its interface, noting available tools and features.

2. **Create a Simple Network**:
   - Drag two computers and one switch onto the workspace.
   - Connect the computers to the switch using Ethernet cables.

3. **Configure IP Addresses for Peer-to-Peer Communication**:
   - Assign the following IP addresses:
     - Computer 1: `192.168.1.1`, Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
     - Computer 2: `192.168.1.2`, Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
   - Configure the IP settings through each computerâ€™s desktop settings in Packet Tracer.

4. **Test the Connection**:
   - Open the Command Prompt on Computer 1 and use the ping command to test connectivity:
     ```bash
     ping 192.168.1.2
     ```

5. **Study Different Types of Network Cables**:
   - Review the cable types available in Packet Tracer and note the color codes associated with each type.

## Observations
- **IP Configuration Steps**:
  - Documented the IP addresses and subnet masks configured on each computer.
  
- **Ping Results**:
  - The ping command confirmed successful communication between the two computers, indicating proper setup.

- **Color Codes for Cables**:
  - Recorded the color codes for Ethernet cables, noting the standards used.

## Conclusion
This lab introduced the foundational concepts of networking using Cisco Packet Tracer. By successfully creating a peer-to-peer network and understanding the types of cables and their color codes, the importance of these concepts in networking was highlighted. Mastering these basics is crucial for anyone pursuing a career in network administration or engineering, as they form the basis for more advanced networking topics.
